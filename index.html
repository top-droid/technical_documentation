            <p>
                CSS selectors are the foundation of styling elements in a webpage. They are patterns used to target HTML
                elements for applying specific styles. Selectors can range from simple element names to more complex
                patterns like class names, IDs, or even attribute-based selections. By utilizing these selectors,
                developers can precisely define which HTML elements should be styled in specific ways, making the
                website both functional and visually appealing.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several types of CSS selectors, each serving a distinct purpose. The most basic selector is
                the
                type selector, which targets elements by their tag name <span class="bold">(e.g., p, div, h1)</span>.
                Class selectors <span class="bold">(.className)</span> allow styling multiple elements with the same
                class, while ID selectors <span class="bold">(#idName)</span> are used for unique elements. Pseudo-class
                selectors like <span class="bold">:hover</span> can style elements based on user interaction, and
                attribute selectors target elements with specific attributes. Together, these selectors give developers
                granular control over how their website looks and behaves.

                &lt;style&gt;
                  p {
                    color: blue;
                  }
                  .highlight {
                    font-weight: bold;
                  }
                  #intro {
                    font-size: 20px;
                  }
                &lt;/style&gt;
                
                &lt;p id="intro"&gt;This is an introductory paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="highlight"&gt;This is highlighted text.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This text is blue but not highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

        <section class="main-section" id="box_model">
            <header class="bold">Box Model</header>
            <p>
                The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that defines how the elements on a webpage are structured and
                spaced. Every HTML element is considered as a rectangular box, consisting of four areas: content,
                padding, border, and margin. The content area is where the actual content resides, followed by padding,
                which creates space around the content. The border surrounds the padding, and the outermost area is the
                margin, which provides space between the element and its neighboring elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling layout and spacing. By adjusting these areas, you
                can control how much space an element occupies and how it interacts with surrounding elements. The box
                model properties allow you to fine-tune the appearance and responsiveness of your design, especially
                when combined with layout techniques like Flexbox or Grid.
            </p>
            <code>
            &lt;div style="width: 200px; padding: 10px; border: 5px solid black; margin: 20px;"&gt;
  This box has padding, a border, and margin.
&lt;/div&gt;

        <section class="main-section" id="flexbox">
            <header class="bold">Flexbox</header>
            <p>
                CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a powerful layout module that allows you to align and distribute
                space among items within a container efficiently. Flexbox is particularly helpful for creating
                responsive layouts, as it enables easy alignment of elements in various directions and sizes without
                needing float or positioning hacks. The key components of Flexbox are the container (with <span
                    class="bold">display: flex</span>) and its child elements, called flex items.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Flexbox, you can control the direction, alignment, spacing, and wrapping of flex items. It
                simplifies the process of building dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content,
                making it an essential tool for modern web design.
            </p>
            <code>
            &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;"&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;Item 1&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;Item 2&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;Item 3&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

        <section class="main-section" id="text_styling">
            <header class="bold">Text Styling</header>
            <p>
                Text styling in CSS involves controlling the appearance of text on a webpage. You can modify the font
                size, weight, style, color, alignment, and more using various CSS properties. Common properties include
                <span class="bold">font-size, color, font-family, text-align,</span> and <span
                    class="bold">text-decoration</span>. These properties allow you to create visually appealing and
                readable content, which is critical for enhancing user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, <span class="bold">font-weight</span> can make text bold, while <span
                    class="bold">text-decoration</span> can be used to underline or strike through text. By combining
                these properties, you can set different typographic styles that match the theme and purpose of your
                website.
            </p>
            <code>
            &lt;p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333; text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;
  This is a styled paragraph of text.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <section class="main-section" id="positioning">
            <header class="bold">Positioning</header>
            <p>
                CSS positioning allows you to control the exact placement of an element on the webpage. There are
                several types of positioning: <span class="bold">static, relative, absolute, fixed,</span> and <span class="bold">sticky</span>. Each defines how an element
                is positioned in relation to its normal flow or other elements. For example, <span class="bold">relative</span> positions an
                element relative to its normal position, while <span class="bold">absolute</span> positions it relative to its nearest positioned
                ancestor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Positioning is key to creating complex layouts, overlays, or sticky headers. When used effectively, it
                gives you precise control over the layout and design of your web pages.
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;div style="position: relative; top: 20px; left: 30px;"&gt;
  This element is positioned 20px from the top and 30px from the left of its normal position.
&lt;/div&gt;
